  <h1>Blaseball</h1>
  <p>Oh, man. Blaseball. I <strong>love</strong> Blaseball. I got into it Season 9 (October 2020) when my ex-boyfriend showed me a video about Blaseball history. I, tiredly (because it was 1am), chose a team and got into it. It was worth it!</p>
                    <p>Blaseball is a text-based absurdist baseball simulator that started in July of 2020. Lots of weird things happen, like players dying. The community creates lore for the randomly generated characters, and it's overall a great time.</p>
                    <p>My favourite part of Blaseball is definitely watching my team crawl its way out of unfortunate circumstances into championships! The Charleston Shoe Thieves are dangerous in the post-season.</p>
